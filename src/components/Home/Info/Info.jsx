          The British Academy Games Awards are an annual British awards ceremony
          honoring "outstanding creative achievement" in the video game
          industry. First presented in 2004 following the restructuring of the
          BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards, the awards are presented by
          the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), and are thus
          commonly referred to as the BAFTA Games .
